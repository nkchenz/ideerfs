1. Modify ../config.py

Generally speaking you only need to tell me where is meta_dev

    meta_dev = 'your-own-path/ideerfs/test/tmp/sd1'

Replace 'your-own-path' with the dir path where you store 'ideerfs',
formatfs.py will create disks under test/tmp, and use sd1 as meta_dev by
default.

2. Format fs and prepare for disks

    ./formatfs.py

3. Start servers on localhost, online disks

    ./startfs.py

4. Stop servers

    ./stopfs.py
