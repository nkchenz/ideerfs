- server crash transparent for client
- object COW + cp
- aio, queue and worker model
- simple mapreduce

- journal and lock
- meta lookup cache
- pwd is not multi client safe
- client buffer
- chunk piping and replicating

flush data into disk periodically. It only reads data, should not effect
server reponse time. What matters is how to recovery from crash.
