=TODO=

- server crash transparent for client
- object COW + cp
- aio, queue and worker model
- simple mapreduce

- journal and lock
- meta lookup cache
- pwd is not multi client safe
- client buffer
- chunk piping and replicating


CheckPoint:
If you want to flush mem data, you shall acquire a global lock to protect it
being written, which will hold server from further request processing, that's
unacceptable.

Current implementation is leaving mem data untouched, load old cp file, replay
logs and then flush back.

You can't snapshot an object if it's keeping changing, like shooting a moving
target.

It's different with flushing dirty file pages to disk.


epoll:
Request processing thread shall be very carefully not be blocked on one
request, waiting for io to be done.

Conn:
  data
  seq
  request
  response


aio and callbacks, notify operation done
